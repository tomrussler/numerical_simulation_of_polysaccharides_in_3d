**Numerical Simulation of Three-Dimensional Polysaccharide Structures**

This repository contains scripts written in python that can be used by the graphic visualization software Blender. 
The scripts are capable of simulating different polysaccharides structures. In the src directory the main script can be found.
The program Blender which is free should be installed when opening the numerical_simulation_of_polysaccharides_in_3d.blend file.
The script can be executed and a predefined polysaccharide structure is simulated. To simulate a specific desired polysaccharide
structure please read the documenation.
